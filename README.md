  - Change the sign beside it from '+' to '-' if it is opened and vice versa
- Should delete the corresponding FAQ on clicking the delete button.
- Clicking the Add button should: 
  - Display an alert with the text 'Please add both question and answer' if either of the text boxes is empty
  - Create a new Question and Answer and show it on the screen
